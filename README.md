I did some planning before really start to code, I drawed what the result I expect it to be like
and then wrote down the main point.

1, Fetch Data
2, Set up Pie Chart
3, Set up Charts
4, Set up Button
5, Set list of cards

Future plan for the application:
1, Improve the CSS
2, Add a button for each chart
3, Add a form to let user to update the API (If the API allow to)
4, Show details of each interaction, if the data has added more details other than just id and date.
5, Add Comments to explain the code
